# Deep Learning Coursera specialization by deeplearning.ai
This repository hosts the solution of all the weekly quizzes and programming assignments of all five courses in Deep Learning specialization by **deeplearning.ai** on Coursera.

The first course is: **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**. 
In this first course of the specialization, you will
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks 
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks 
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture 



I would like to present my hearful thanks to instructor **Andrew Ng** for such a wonderful explanation on the topics!
