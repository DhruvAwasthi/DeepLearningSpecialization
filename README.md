# Deep Learning Specialization by Andrew Ng (deeplearning.ai) on Coursera
I would like to present my heartful thanks to instructor **Andrew Ng** for coming up with such a wonderful course & a wonderful explanation on the topics! I really learned a lot from you!

This repository contains the solution of all the weekly quizzes and programming assignments of all five courses in Deep Learning specialization by **deeplearning.ai** on Coursera.

---

The first course is: **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**.

After completing this first course in the specialziation, now I
- Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning
- Am able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks
- Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks
- Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture (forward propagation and backward propagation).

---

The second course is: **Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization**.

After completing this second course in the specialization, now I
- Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications
- Am able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking
- Am able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence
- Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance
- Am able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.

---

The third course is: **Structuring Machine Learning Projects**.

After completing this third course in the specialization, now I
- Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and
- Am able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
- Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
- Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning.

The fourth course is: **Convolutional Neural Networks**.

After completing this fourth course in the specialization, now I
- Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
- Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
- Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
- am able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.

The fifth course is: **Sequence Models**.

After completing this fifth and final course in the specialization, now I
- Understand how to build and train Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and commonly-used variants such as GRUs and LSTMs.
- Am able to apply sequence models to natural language problems, including text synthesis.
- Am able to apply sequence models to audio applications, including speech recognition and music synthesis.
